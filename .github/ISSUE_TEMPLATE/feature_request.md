# User Story

<details>
    <summary>Guidance on how to write user stories</summary>
    <p>Where possible, we prefer to frame each piece of work in terms of the features that it provides to users.</p>
    <p>There can be different types of users e.g. customers, or another team that we are providing a service to.</p>
    <p>After reading a user story, the team knows why they are implementing a feature, what they're building, and what value it creates.</p>
    <p>Good user story examples:</p>
    <pre>
As a customer of the example.com website
Given there is an issue with an area of the website
I want to receive an informative message
So that I know the problem is being addressed
    </pre>
    <pre>
As a member of the website team
I want to be able to enable and disable each of the site's outage pages
So that customers are provided appropriate information and a good experience, when the website is unable to service their needs
    </pre>
    <p>Bad user story examples</p>
    <pre>
As a member of the SRE team
I want to implement outage page controls
So that outage pages can be switched on and off
    </pre>

# Acceptance Criteria

<details>
    <summary>Guidance on how to write Acceptance Criteria</summary>
    <p>The acceptance criteria (ACs) of a feature are the criteria which must be met to mark a user story complete.</p>
    <p>ACs should be implemented as a numbered list, so that they can be referred to by their number.</p>
    <p>ACs should typically be phrased from the user's point of view, and should not be a list of technical tasks</p>
    <p>Good example of ACs:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Users in the IAM group x are able to enable / disable holding pages.</li>
        <li>Users can observe the current status of each holding page.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Bad example of ACs:
    <ol>
        <li>Add a feature toggle in the code to control the status of holding pages.</li>
        <li>Add a widget in the holding page New Relic dashbord to show the status of each holding page.</li>
    </ol>
