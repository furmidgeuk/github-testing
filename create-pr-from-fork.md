# ðŸš€ How to Fork a Repository and Raise a PR in GitHub

If you **donâ€™t have write access** to a repository but still need to submit a **Pull Request (PR)**, you can do this by **forking the repository** and **raising a PR from your fork**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Steps to Fork the Repository

1. **Go to the Repository**  
   - Navigate to the GitHub repository you want to contribute to.  

2. **Fork the Repository**  
   - Click on the **Fork** button (top-right corner).  
   - GitHub will create a **copy of the repository under your account**.  

3. **Clone Your Fork Locally**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
   ```
   - Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.  
   - Replace `REPO-NAME` with the repository name.  

4. **Navigate to the Cloned Repo**  
   ```sh
   cd REPO-NAME
   ```

## ðŸ”¹ Set Up the Upstream Repository

By default, your fork only knows about your **own repository copy**. You need to **link it to the original repository** to pull the latest changes.

1. **Check the Current Git Remotes**  
   ```sh
   git remote -v
   ```
   You should see something like:
   ```
   origin  https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git (push)
   ```

2. **Add the Upstream Repository (Original Repo)**  
   ```sh
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/REPO-NAME.git
   ```
   Replace `ORIGINAL-OWNER` with the actual owner of the repository.

3. **Verify the Remote Repositories**  
   ```sh
   git remote -v
   ```
   You should now see:
   ```
   origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git (fetch)
   origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git (push)
   upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/REPO-NAME.git (fetch)
   upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/REPO-NAME.git (push)
   ```

## ðŸ”¹ Create a New Branch for Your Changes

1. **Fetch the Latest Changes from Upstream**  
   ```sh
   git fetch upstream
   ```

2. **Create a New Branch**  
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature upstream/main
   ```
   Replace `feat/my-new-feature` with a meaningful branch name.

3. **Make Your Changes**  
   - Modify the necessary files.
   - Save your changes.

4. **Commit Your Changes**  
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add my new feature"
   ```

5. **Push the Changes to Your Fork**  
   ```sh
   git push origin feat/my-new-feature
   ```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Raise a Pull Request  

1. **Go to Your Fork on GitHub**  
   - Navigate to **your forked repository** (`https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME`).
   - You should see a message prompting you to create a PR.

2. **Click "Compare & pull request"**  
   - Ensure that:
     - **Base repository** = `ORIGINAL-OWNER/REPO-NAME`
     - **Base branch** = `main` (or the correct target branch)
     - **Head repository** = `YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME`
     - **Compare branch** = `feat/my-new-feature`

3. **Fill in the PR Details**
   - **Title:** A short summary of your changes.
   - **Description:** Provide details about the changes, why they are needed, and any testing performed.

4. **Submit the PR**
   - Click **"Create Pull Request"**.

## ðŸ”¹ Keep Your Fork Up to Date

If changes are made to the original repository while your PR is open, you may need to **sync your fork**.

1. **Fetch Latest Changes from Upstream**
   ```sh
   git fetch upstream
   ```

2. **Merge the Latest Changes**
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

3. **Push to Your Fork**
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```
